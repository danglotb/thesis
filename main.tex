%intro
Over the last decade, strong unit testing has become an essential component of any serious software project, whether in industry or academia.
The agile development movement has contributed to this cultural change with the global dissemination of test-driven development techniques.
More recently, the DevOps movement has further strengthened the testing practice with an emphasis on continuous and automated testing.
However, testing is tedious and costly for industry: it is hard to evaluate return on investment.
Thus, developers under pressure or by lack of discipline or time might skip writing the tests.

%problem statement
To overcome this problem, research investigates the automation of creating strong tests.
The dream was that a command-line would give you a complete test suite, that verifies the whole program.
Even if automatically generated test suites achieve high coverage, there are still obstacles on the adoption of such techniques by the industry.
This can be explained by the difficulties to understand, integrate and maintain generated test suite.
Also, most of the tools rely on weak or partial oracles, \eg absence of run-time errors, which limits their ability to find bugs.
In this thesis, I aim at addressing the lack of a tool that assists developers in regression testing.
To do so, I use test suite amplification.

%stoa
I defined test amplification and gathered together research works that are using test amplification.
I revealed main challenges of test amplification and the main lacks of the state of the art.
Test suite amplification consists of exploiting the existing manually-written tests, treated as a seed, to achieve a given engineering goal.

%dspot
I propose a new approach based on both test input transformation and assertions generation to amplify the test suite.
This algorithm is implemented by a tool called \dspot.
\dspot works at both level of test methods: input and oracles.

%test-improvement
In this thesis, I evaluated \dspot on open-source projects from \gh.
First, I improved the \ms of test suites and propose these improvement to developers through pull-request.
My evaluation showed that developers value the output of \dspot and thus accepted to integrate amplified test methods into their test suite.
This evidenced that \dspot can improve the quality of real projects' test suites.

%dci
Second, I used \dspot to detect the behavioral difference between two version of the same program.
In particular, I used \dspot to detect the behavioral change introduced by a commit in projects on \gh.
This showed that \dspot can be used in the continuous integration to achieve 2 crucial tasks: 
1) generate amplified test methods that specify a behavioral change, evolving the test suite;
2) generate amplified test methods to improve the ability to detect potential regressions.

%transversal contributions
In this thesis, I also expose 3 transversal contributions that are related to the correctness of program.
First, the study of programs' correctness under runtime perturbations.
Second, the study of pseudo-tested methods that are methods that reveal weaknesses of the test suite.
Third, the study of patch overfitting and test generation for automatic repair.
